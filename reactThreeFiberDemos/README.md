# WebAR.rocks.hand react fiber demos


## Presentation

This directory is fully standalone, that's why it is not in the [/demos](/demos) path like other demonstrations.
To make it work, run from this path:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

THREE.js is used through [Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber).
We also use:
* [react-postprocessing](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-postprocessing)

Only the best demos have been ported to this development environment.

The main script and neural network models have been copied to [src/js/contrib/WebARRocksHand/dist](src/js/contrib/WebARRocksHand/dist) and [src/js/contrib/WebARRocksHand/neuralNets](src/js/contrib/WebARRocksHand/neuralNets).

The helpers have been modified compared to the static ones. They are in [src/js/contrib/WebARRocksHand/helpers](src/js/contrib/WebARRocksHand/helpers)


## Webpack boilerplate original doc

This demo is based on [Webpack boilerplate](https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate)  made by [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia) and released under MIT software license.


### Development server

```bash
npm start
```

You can view the development server at `https://localhost:8443`.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

> Note: Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) globally to deploy a simple server.

```bash
npm i -g http-server
```

You can view the deploy by creating a server in `dist`.

```bash
cd dist && http-server
```
